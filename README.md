# FINAL-PROJECT
These are embedded c codes for interfacing different hardware like unipolar stepper motor, led, ultrasonic sensor, IR sensor, ESP8266 wifi chip with PIC16f877a microcontroller. 
Using MPLAb software and XC8 compiler .
we used esp8266 wifi chip to send data on the Thingsspeak website in real time.
